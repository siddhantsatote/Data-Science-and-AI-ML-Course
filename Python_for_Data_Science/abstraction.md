### **What is Abstraction?**
Abstraction in Python refers to hiding implementation details from the user and only exposing the essential functionalities. It is often implemented using abstract classes and methods in Python, which require subclasses to define specific methods.

The `abc` module (`Abstract Base Classes`) in Python allows us to create abstract classes and methods. An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly.

### **Updated Code Example**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract class to define the contract
class RBI(ABC):
    """
    RBI is an abstract class defining the blueprint for all banks.
    Every bank must implement the methods defined here.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def give_loan(self):
        """Method to process loan approvals."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def open_account(self):
        """Method to open a customer account."""
        pass


# SBI inherits from RBI and implements its methods
class SBI(RBI):
    """
    SBI (State Bank of India) is a concrete implementation of the RBI blueprint.
    It provides the functionalities defined by RBI.
    """

    def give_loan(self):
        print("SBI: Loan processing initiated.")

    def open_account(self):
        print("SBI: Account opened successfully.")

    def deposit(self):
        print("SBI: Amount deposited successfully.")


# Create an instance of SBI and use its methods
if __name__ == "__main__":
    pune_branch = SBI()
    pune_branch.open_account()  # Output: SBI: Account opened successfully.
    pune_branch.give_loan()    # Output: SBI: Loan processing initiated.
    pune_branch.deposit()      # Output: SBI: Amount deposited successfully.

    # Uncommenting the following line will raise an error
    # because RBI is abstract and cannot be instantiated:
    # rbi_pimpri = RBI()
```

### **Key Points**
1. **Abstract Class (`RBI`)**: Defines methods without implementations. Any subclass inheriting from this must implement the abstract methods.
2. **Concrete Class (`SBI`)**: Implements the abstract methods and can define additional methods.
3. **Instantiation Restriction**: Abstract classes like `RBI` cannot be instantiated.
4. **Error-Free Design**: Ensures that every bank (subclass) adheres to the contract defined by RBI.

### **GitHub-Friendly Notes**
1. **Naming Conventions**: Use meaningful names for classes and methods to make the code self-explanatory.
2. **Modular Design**: Keep the code organized and include a main check (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) for standalone execution.
3. **Comments**: Add docstrings and inline comments to explain each component clearly.
