# ================================================
# Set and Set Methods in Python
# ================================================
# A set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements.
# Pythonâ€™s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set.

# Initialize an empty set
emp_s = set()  # Creating an empty set
print(emp_s, type(emp_s))  # This will print an empty set and its type

# Create a set with some initial values
s = {8, 3, 5, 3}  # Creating a set with duplicate values, duplicates will be removed automatically
print(s, type(s))  # Prints the set, duplicates are removed, and the type of the set

# Adding elements to a set using update()
s.update([4, 1, 5, 2])  # Adding multiple elements from a list
print(s)

s.update("Hi")  # Adding each character from the string "Hi"
print(s)

# Add method is used to add a single element to the set
s.add((54, 65, 12, 96))  # Adding a tuple as a single element
print(s)

s.add("Hello")  # Adding a string element to the set
print(s)

# Remove method removes the specified element from the set
s.remove(5)  # Removes the element '5' from the set
print(s)

s.remove("H")  # Removes the element 'H' from the set
print(s)

# s.remove(1000)  # Uncommenting this line will raise a KeyError because 1000 is not in the set

# Discard method is similar to remove, but does not raise an error if the element is not found
s.discard((54, 65, 12, 96))  # Removes the tuple from the set
print(s)

s.discard("i")  # Removes the element 'i', but does not raise an error if it's not in the set
print(s)

s.discard(1000)  # 1000 is not in the set, no error occurs
print(s)

# Pop method removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set
s.pop()  # Removes an arbitrary element
print(s)

s.pop()  # Removes another arbitrary element
print(s)

# Copy method creates a shallow copy of the set
s1 = s.copy()  # Copying the set to a new set
print(s1)

# Clear method removes all elements from the set
s1.clear()  # Clears all elements in s1
print(s1)

s.clear()  # Clears all elements in s
print(s)


# Set Operations (Union, Intersection, Difference, Symmetric Difference)
s1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}  # Set 1
s2 = {2, 4, 6, 8}  # Set 2

# Union returns all elements from both sets
print("Union -", s1.union(s2))  # Using union method
print("Union -", s1 | s2)  # Using '|' operator for union

# Intersection returns only the elements that are common in both sets
print("Intersection -", s1.intersection(s2))  # Using intersection method
print("Intersection -", s1 & s2)  # Using '&' operator for intersection

# Difference returns elements in s1 that are not in s2
print("Difference -", s1.difference(s2))  # Using difference method
print("Difference -", s2.difference(s1))  # Using difference method with reversed sets
print("Difference -", s1 - s2)  # Using '-' operator for difference
print("Difference -", s2 - s1)  # Using '-' operator for difference

# Symmetric Difference returns elements that are in either set, but not in both
print("Symmetric Difference -", s1.symmetric_difference(s2))  # Using symmetric_difference method
print("Symmetric Difference -", s1 ^ s2)  # Using '^' operator for symmetric difference


# ================================================
# Tuple Methods in Python
# ================================================
# A tuple is similar to a list but with immutable elements. Once a tuple is created, it cannot be modified.

t = (1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 6, 2, 3, 3)  # Creating a tuple with some duplicate values

# Index method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element
print(t.index(3))  # Returns the index of the first occurrence of '3'
print(t.index(6))  # Returns the index of the first occurrence of '6'

# Count method returns the number of occurrences of a specified element
print(t.count(3))  # Counts how many times '3' appears in the tuple
print(t.count(6))  # Counts how many times '6' appears in the tuple
```

### **Explanation of Code:**

#### **Set Methods:**
1. **Set Basics:**
   - A **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets automatically remove duplicates when they are created.
   
2. **Methods to Modify Sets:**
   - **`update()`**: Adds multiple elements from an iterable (like a list or string) to the set.
   - **`add()`**: Adds a single element to the set.
   - **`remove()`**: Removes a specified element from the set. Throws an error if the element is not found.
   - **`discard()`**: Removes an element from the set, but does not throw an error if the element is not found.
   - **`pop()`**: Removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set.
   - **`copy()`**: Creates a shallow copy of the set.
   - **`clear()`**: Clears all elements from the set.

3. **Set Operations:**
   - **Union**: Combines all elements from both sets.
   - **Intersection**: Returns only the elements common to both sets.
   - **Difference**: Returns elements in the first set that are not in the second set.
   - **Symmetric Difference**: Returns elements that are in either set but not in both.

#### **Tuple Methods:**
1. **Tuple Basics:**
   - A **tuple** is an immutable collection. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed.

2. **Tuple Methods:**
   - **`index()`**: Finds the first occurrence of the specified element in the tuple and returns its index.
   - **`count()`**: Counts how many times a specified element appears in the tuple.

### **Additional Notes:**
- **Sets** are commonly used to eliminate duplicates from a collection, check for membership, and perform mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.
- **Tuples** are used for storing fixed collections of items that should not be changed, and their methods allow for retrieving information about their contents.
